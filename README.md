Homework assignment 1 for learning GIT. 


I will probably use the following command frequntly:

  1. git checkout to change branches
  2. git add to add files to staging
  3. git push to commit changes to remote
  4. git merge to merge branches to the master
  5. git diff to view differences between repositories
  6. git status to view the status of my repository and stage
  7. git init to initialize a repository
  8. git commit to commit changes to local
  9. git branch to make a new branch
  10. git remote to create a remote repository, not just local
  11. git pull to get the most recent version of the remote repository
